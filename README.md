## Purpose:
Project is a recreation of Airbnb's Experiences page. Purpose of building a copy of a website is to practice front-end development skills and learn the fundamentals of React JS. Page consists of a navbar with the Airbnb logo, a hero section with an image, and another section titled Experiences that describes what it is and showcases a few available Experiences in cards. Each card is dynamically generated by mapping over data provided from an external data source to mimic an API call. The provided design files only specified a mobile view but application is fully responsive. Project utilizes one of React's greatest strengths: Component Driven Development(CDD). Page is seperated into components with their own CSS files for better seperation of concerns. 

 ## Technologies Used:
  - HTML5/CSS3/ReactJS
  - Netlify/Github for hosting and CI/CD
